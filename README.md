### Future TODO:

- functionality to create note without having to register for an account, later should be able to assign this note to your account, and also should still be able to change visibility to public 

- favorites tab, heart your favorite notes, should be able to favorite public notes and have them stored 

- ability to fork off a public note and add it to your own account

- account features such as change name or password

- email verification / email login




##### Fixes:

- if public note does not exist, display better error message
